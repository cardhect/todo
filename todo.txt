//TODO Delete btn not working on every display section
//Note: Delete button throws error when on a different view other than list because code trys to access the list through the name of the todo view title
//Possible Fix: Add list prop to todo obj and access it that way.

//BUG When todo is deleted in a view or corresponding list it still shows in other views
//Possible fix, make each list view button access the todos each time and update accordilingt
